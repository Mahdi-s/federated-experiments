# Federated Learning for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Segmentation

## Overview
Welcome to our repository, where we experiment with federated learning and medical image analysis to address diabetic foot ulcer segmentation. This repository hosts a suite of Jupyter notebooks meticulously crafted to facilitate researchers and practitioners in biomedical engineering and computer science fields.

### What is Federated Learning?
Federated learning is a machine learning technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them. This is particularly beneficial for medical data, where privacy and confidentiality are paramount.

### Why Diabetic Foot Ulcers?
Diabetic foot ulcers are a common complication of diabetes, leading to significant morbidity and even mortality. Early and accurate segmentation can lead to better treatment outcomes and improve quality of life for many patients.
