    "#### Central Training Notebook without differential Privacy\r\n",
    "This notebook helps you set up a central machine learning workflow involving a Neural Network based on UNET architecture. It consists o f  sections starting from loading necessary external modules, i.e., pytorch, albumentations, and wandb, to name a few. Next, we'll move to loading our data, modifying it to ensure consistency, and finally defining our model and training. The last section involves examining the results of training, to ensure the validity of the model and ensuring privacy is preserved since we intend to use the model on sensitive medical data."

    "### 3. UNET Model Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided class defines a deep learning architecture called \"UNET,\" which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) commonly used for semantic image segmentation tasks. UNET is known for its symmetric architecture with a contracting path (encoder) and an expansive path (decoder). The code is structured into two main classes: DoubleConv and UNET.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DoubleConv class represents a basic building block within the UNET architecture. It consists of two consecutive convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization and a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. This sequence of operations is designed to capture and enhance important image features while maintaining spatial information. The class is parameterized by the number of input channels (in_channels) and the number of output channels (out_channels) for the convolutional layers. These building blocks are used both in the contracting and expanding paths of the UNET architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UNET class defines the UNET architecture itself. It takes several arguments, including the number of input channels (in_channels), the number of output channels (out_channels), and a list of feature map sizes (features) that determine the depth of the network. The UNET architecture consists of a downsampling (encoder) path, a bottleneck layer, and an upsampling (decoder) path. The downsampling path repeatedly applies the DoubleConv blocks while reducing spatial dimensions through max-pooling operations. The bottleneck layer further captures abstract features. The upsampling path includes transposed convolutional layers to upsample the feature maps and concatenate them with skip connections from the downsampling path. Finally, a 1x1 convolutional layer is applied to produce the segmentation mask."

    "A.Resize: Resizes the input images to a specified height and width (IMAGE_HEIGHT and IMAGE_WIDTH), ensuring that all training images have consistent dimensions.\n",
    "A.Rotate: Randomly rotates the images within a specified limit (35 degrees in this case) to increase the diversity of training samples. This helps the model generalize better to different orientations of objects in the images.\n",
    "A.HorizontalFlip: Randomly flips images horizontally with a probability of 0.5. This operation simulates variations in object orientation, contributing to better model robustness.\n",
    "A.VerticalFlip: Randomly flips images vertically with a lower probability (0.1). It introduces additional variability by considering vertical reflections of objects.\n",
    "A.Normalize: Standardizes pixel values by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. In this case, it centers the data around zero with unit variance. The max_pixel_value parameter ensures that pixel values are in the [0, 1] range.\n",
    "ToTensorV2: Converts the image and mask data into PyTorch tensors, making them compatible with the model's input format.\n",

    "This transformation pipeline is intended for preprocessing images in the validation dataset. It includes:\n",
    "A.Resize: Resizes the validation images to the same height and width as specified for the training images, ensuring consistent dimensions between the training and validation datasets.\n",
    "A.Normalize: Performs the same pixel value normalization as in the training transform. However, it doesn't include data augmentation operations like rotation or flips, as the goal of validation is to evaluate the model's performance on unaltered data.\n",

    "Hyperparameter Exploration Loop: The code defines a loop that iterates over different batch sizes and image sizes. Inside this loop, it reconfigures the batch size and image dimensions according to the current iteration. This allows for a systematic exploration of how these hyperparameters affect model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training and Evaluation: For each combination of batch size and image size, the code sets up data loaders, model, loss function, optimizer, and other training-related components. It then performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Validates the model on the validation dataset to record initial performance metrics.\n",
    "Conducts training for a specified number of epochs, saving model checkpoints and recording training metrics (e.g., accuracy, dice score, IoU) for each epoch.\n",
    "Appends the results of each epoch to a DataFrame, allowing for easy tracking and analysis of training progress.\n",
    "Saves the DataFrame as a CSV file, preserving the training and evaluation results for later analysis."
